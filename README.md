# airconditioner_cooling_capacity

Create a new Room class that will represent a room to be cooled by an air conditioning unit. 
The Room class will have fields for the following data:
  The name of the room.
  The length of the room.
  The width of the room.
  The amount of shade the room receives (this should be a String value).
The Room class should have the following methods:
  A no-arg constructor that explicitly initializes all fields.
  A constructor that accepts the following values as arguments and assigns them to the appropriate fields: room name, length of the room, weight of the room, amount of shade.
  A method named getArea that accepts no arguments and returns the area of the room.
  A method named getBTUsPerHour that accepts no arguments and returns the BTUs per Hour that are needed to adequately cool that room.
  A method named displayRoomInformation that accepts no arguments and prints out the room name, length of the room, weight of the room, amount of shade, and BTUs per Hour that are needed to adequately cool the room
